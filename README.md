# To interpret user needs, it is best to try to think like a user and not a developer. As the developer it is easy to know all the ins and out of a self made program, but users do not have all this information. That is why they are called User Stories, they are what the user will want to do so the program must best take into account that in the end it will be a user that the program caters to.
# Developing programs should be looked at as a step by step process that can loop around. There will be some times that the steps needed for a finished program are clear and other times that they are unclear. The flexibility that agile allows for is the best thing that can be taken away from learning about it.
# A good team member does a few simple things. They get their work done on time or ask for help if needed. They do not distract other team members. Most importantly they act like they want their other team mebers to act.
